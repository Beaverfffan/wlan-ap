Subject: [PATCH 3/4] hostapd: fix simultaneous scanning failure in case of MLO

Currently only 1 scan can be performed on per phy level at a time
in mac80211. Due to this, if via other underlying radio, a scan
request is sent, kernel returns -EBUSY. And then hostapd would
try to set the interface in station mode if it was originally
in AP mode and retry sending a scan request. However, this
behaviour is expected in case of multi link operation and hence
there is no need to switch the mode as such.

Hence, add logic to not change the nl mode if kernel returns
-EBUSY during multi link AP operation. The caller can accordingly
decide and if needed, it can re-schedule a scan request after
some time.
